            Context
          </h2>
          <p>
            Virtual and Augmented Reality experiences (XR) leverage the availability of head-mounted displays and environment sensing capabilities to create immersive worlds, where users can virtually meet, collaborate, and interact. Each world comes with its own rules and mechanisms, with limited possible interactions between worlds.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a corresponding growing interest in the ability to create links and continuity between immersive worlds, e.g. through the use of avatars, of affordances to maintain group presence across experiences. While the web has evolved to support low-level primitives for XR (WebXR), immersive worlds require additional semantics to handle users' presence, localization, interactions with virtual artefacts and people, and navigation within and in-between immersive worlds.

            What is the purpose of this workshop?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Following previous W3C workshops on <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/06/vr-workshop/report.html">Web &amp; Virtual Reality</a> (2016), <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/09/webvr-authoring-workshop/">WebVR Authoring</a> (2017) and <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/08/inclusive-xr-workshop/report.html">Inclusive Design for Immersive Web standards</a> (2019), this workshop connects the web platform and immersive worlds creators and users, and explores evolutions of the web platform to address immersive worlds requirements. Overall goals are to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Develop a vision for immersive worlds on the web: usages, ethical challenges, role of browsers;</li>
            <li>Grow a common set of principles for immersive worlds: presence, localization, interactions, navigation mechanisms, linking capabilities, etc.;</li>
            <li>Identify gaps in the web platform and standardization opportunities.</li>

            What is W3C?
          </h2>
          <p>
            W3C is a voluntary standards consortium that convenes companies and
            communities to help structure productive discussions around existing
            and emerging technologies, and offers a Royalty-Free patent framework
            for Web Recommendations. We focus primarily on client-side (browser)
            technologies, and also have a mature history of vocabulary (or
            “ontology”) development. W3C develops work based on the priorities of
            our members and our community.
