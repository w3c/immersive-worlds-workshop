      <p>W3C is organizing a workshop to explore the impacts of immersive worlds on technologies that compose the web platform.</p>

      <p>For more details on the conference, see <a href="index.html">call for participation</a>.</p>

      <p>Sponsoring the W3C workshop on immersive worlds on the web shows leadership and helps move the dialog forward.</p>

        <h3 id="why">Why sponsor this workshop?</h3>
        <p>The cost to hold this virtual workshop includes costs for post-processing the pre-recorded talks (captioning, video/slides synchronization, packaging) and other considerations.</p>

        <p>Most of the planning, coordination, agenda building, and writing outcome reports are done for no cost by W3C staff or volunteers. But without sponsorships, these organizations cannot hold workshops.</p>

        <p>If you see value in discussing professional media production on the Web, and believe it will help your business, sponsoring is the best way to ensure that this conversation happens, and that you are seen as a leader and a forward-looking enabler of the technical evolution of the Web.</p>

        <p>W3C Workshops, meetups, and other events bring you into direct contact with leading Web technology experts: representatives from industry, research, government, and the developer community.</p>
        <p>Whether your interests are focused on a particular topic being discussed by a Working Group, or you wish to reach a diverse international audience setting W3C&#39;s strategic direction, sponsorship helps your organization reach W3C&#39;s engaged participants.</p>
        <p>Sponsorships offset a portion of our meeting costs, so W3C welcomes multiple sponsors for each event. All proposals for sponsorship are subject to W3C approval.</p>
